This Firefox web extension adds an icon to the browser's top bar
which lets you close the current tab by clicking it.

Some people prefer the keyboard shortcut CTRL+W,
some like to click icons :)

This was actually my first test-run on writing your own web extensions and publishing it.
More of a playground than an actual real-world need.

Oh, and it is available in the Mozilla addon repo under:
